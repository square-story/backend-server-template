# 🚨 Quick Fix: fs-extra Module Error

## ❌ The Problem

When you tried to use `create-backend-server`, you got this error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'fs-extra'
```

This happened because `fs-extra` was in `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`.

## ✅ The Solution

I've fixed the issue by:

1. **Moving `fs-extra` to dependencies** - Now it's available when the package is installed
2. **Adding path validation** - Prevents creating projects inside the template directory
3. **Adding postinstall script** - Ensures the generate script is executable after installation

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Package Dependencies
```json
// Before (incorrect)
"devDependencies": {
  "fs-extra": "^11.2.0"
}

// After (correct)
"dependencies": {
  "fs-extra": "^11.2.0"
}
```

### 2. Path Validation
Added check to prevent copying template to itself:
```javascript
// Ensure we're not copying to a subdirectory of the template
if (projectDir.startsWith(templateDir + path.sep)) {
    console.log('❌ Error: Cannot create project inside the template directory');
    console.log('💡 Please run the command from a different directory');
    process.exit(1);
}
```

### 3. Postinstall Script
```json
"postinstall": "chmod +x generate-project.js"
```

## 🚀 How to Use Now

### Option 1: Wait for Updated Package
```bash
# The package will be updated to version 2.0.1
npm update -g backend-server-template
```

### Option 2: Test Locally First
```bash
# In the template directory
npm install -g .
create-backend-server
```

### Option 3: Use from Different Directory
```bash
# Navigate to a different directory first
cd ~/Desktop
create-backend-server
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

The package now passes all tests:
```bash
npm run test
# ✅ All tests passed! Package is ready for publishing.
```

## 📦 Next Steps

1. **Publish the updated package**:
   ```bash
   npm run publish:package
   ```

2. **Users can then install and use**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g backend-server-template
   create-backend-server
   ```

## 🔍 Why This Happened

- **Development vs Production**: `fs-extra` was needed at runtime but was in devDependencies
- **Global Installation**: When installed globally, only `dependencies` are available
- **Path Resolution**: The generator needed better validation for project locations

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ `fs-extra` moved to dependencies
- ✅ Path validation added
- ✅ Postinstall script added
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Ready for publishing

The package should now work correctly when installed globally! 🎉
